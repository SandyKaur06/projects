In this project, I employed various feature representation techniques and word embeddings to encode the underlying information
in the data. I then used different Machine Learning techniques to understand which one is more effective. 
This comparative analysis involved assessing the efficacy of each technique in capturing the 
nuanced information present in the data. Notably, I juxtaposed these traditional methods with a deep learning approach, 
seeking to discern the relative effectiveness of different methodologies. I also compared these to a deep learning method 
to show the differences and efficacy. 

Through this rigorous evaluation, I aimed to identify the most suitable and effective techniques for the specific task 
at hand. The insights gained from this comparative study not only shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of various 
approaches but also contribute to the broader discourse on the optimal application of machine learning and deep learning 
techniques in similar contexts.
